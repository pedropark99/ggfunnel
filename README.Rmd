# `ggfunnel`

`{ggfunnel}` is a R package that uses `{ggplot2}` to create Power BI like funnel charts in R. `ggfunnel::funnel()` is the main function of the package, responsible for producing the plot. The basic example below will produce the following plot:

```{r, eval = TRUE}
library(ggfunnel)
plot <- ggfunnel::aggregates |>
  ggfunnel::funnel(
    values = N_users, levels = Step
  )

print(plot)
```
